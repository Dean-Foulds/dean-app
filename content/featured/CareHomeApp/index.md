We at CIVIC REACTOR have noticed that more and more is expected to be done for less, we as a volunteer organisation are committed to the improvement to access and publicly open data resources. to allow for wider usage and research from that data.

Civic reactors can be young, old, beginners, experts, programmers, designers, data scientists, good communicators, civic organisers, entrepreneurs, employers, employees and unemployed. Actually anyone willing to get his or her hands dirty solving problems who collaborate on co-creating solutions as a response to social, environmental and economic challenges relevant to their city.

Following the goals of the open data movement are similar to those of other "open" movements such as open source, open hardware, open content and open access and making these things available and usable information for all.
